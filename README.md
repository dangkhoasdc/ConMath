There is a collection of my notes through the journey of `Concrete Mathematics - A Foundation for Computer Scienne` [link](https://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Mathematics-Foundation-Computer-Science/dp/0201558025).  All solutions in the notes may be not absolutely correct.

Current Reading:
- Recurrent Problems


Other books
===========

Some mathematic books I think they could help `cs` students to master the subject:

- SICP.
- CLRS: a de facto algorithm book.
- Algorithms: Sedgewick - I like the book much more than `CLRS`, especially in terms of practice.
